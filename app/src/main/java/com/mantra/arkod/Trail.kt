/**
 * THE LIVE STATE, IN ONE PLACE.
 *
 * Two things deliver fixes: the screen, while it is open, and the recording service, while it is
 * running with the screen off. They both hand them here, and this decides what is true. Two
 * places holding "where am I" is two places to drift apart (README.md rule 1), and the drift
 * would show as the dot and the track disagreeing about the same moment.
 *
 * STATE AND REALITY ARE TWO FACTS AND THEY WILL DISAGREE (design-language.md 14). `recording` is a
 * claim; `recording != null` is checked at the point of use rather than trusted from a flag held
 * somewhere else.
