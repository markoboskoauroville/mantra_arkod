/**
 * GPX 1.1, AND IT IS WRITTEN AS THE WALK HAPPENS.
 *
 * WHY GPX. It is the one track format everything reads: Garmin, Strava, Komoot, OsmAnd, Locus,
 * QGIS, Google Earth. It is plain XML with a published schema, so a file recorded here can still
 * be opened in twenty years by something nobody has written yet. FIT is Garmin's binary, TCX is
 * its retired predecessor, KML is Google's and carries no track semantics worth the name.
 *
 * WHY POINT BY POINT. A file assembled at the end is a file that does not exist when the battery
 * dies on the ridge. The header is written when recording starts, every accepted fix is appended
 * and flushed, and the footer is the only thing left to lose — so a truncated file costs the
 * closing tags, which any repair adds back, rather than the walk.
 *
 * No Android imports (android-app.md 1): this builds strings, the caller owns the stream.
