/**
 * WHAT THE NETWORK IS DOING, ON THE SCREEN, ALWAYS.
 *
 * Baba, 15.9.2026: *"I want to have in this app download indicator. If something is downloading,
 * I want to see a speed... I'm waiting for it to download. Since I don't have indicator, I don't
 * know what's going on."*
 *
 * That is the whole complaint about this app in one sentence: it does long work in silence, and
 * silence and failure look identical (silent-failure.md). A map tile that is being fetched, a map
 * file that is being downloaded, and a map that is simply not coming are three different things,
 * and until now the screen showed the same nothing for all three.
 *
 * THE MEASUREMENT IS THE PHONE'S OWN. TrafficStats counts every byte this app's user id has
 * received since boot, so it covers mapsforge's own tile fetching — which happens inside the
 * library where no counter of ours could reach it — as well as our downloads. The number is
 * therefore real rather than reported by the thing being measured.
 *
 * AND WHEN NOTHING IS MOVING IT SAYS SO. Zero bytes a second while a map is blank is itself the
 * answer: the map is not waiting for the network, so the problem is elsewhere.
