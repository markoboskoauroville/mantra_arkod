/**
 * THE KEYS COME FROM A FILE ON THE PHONE AND FROM NOWHERE ELSE.
 *
 * Baba, 14.9.2026, after a Maps key went out inside a public APK: *"This is public app. My key
 * cannot be inside. Please remove the key. Only work with key picker. Key picker is the key."*
 *
 * So no key is compiled into this app, no key is in the repository, and no build has one. A key
 * arrives when he picks a file, is read BY SHAPE, is kept in the app's own private storage, and
 * is shown to nobody — not even to him, because a key on a screen is a key in a screenshot.
 *
 * WHICH SERVICE A KEY BELONGS TO IS DECIDED BY ITS SHAPE, not by asking him to sort them:
 *
 *   Google         AIza… or AQ.… — Google's own key formats
 *   Thunderforest  thirty-two hexadecimal characters, which is the shape their keys take
 *
 * No Android imports (android-app.md 1), so Test 1 attacks the parser with the awkward files a
 * real note contains: account names above the key, tracking URLs below it, blank lines, prose.
