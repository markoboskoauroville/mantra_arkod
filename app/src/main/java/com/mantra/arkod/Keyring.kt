/**
 * THE KEYRING: SEVERAL KEYS, NOT ONE. No Android imports (android-app.md 1).
 *
 * Baba, 17.9.2026, pointing at his own KEY_RING_TESTER: a list of keys he can add to, test one by
 * one, see the result of beside each, delete, and have the app fall back through when one stops
 * working. One key in a preference could not do any of that, and when it failed — as his did for
 * half a day — there was nothing to compare it against.
 *
 * A key is kept whole because it has to be used, and shown masked because it has to be read over
 * somebody's shoulder. What is remembered about each is what it answered the last time it was
 * asked, which is the only thing that decides whether it is worth trying next.
