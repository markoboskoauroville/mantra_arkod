/**
 * SAYING WHICH APP IS ASKING (17.9.2026).
 *
 * The key is restricted in Cloud Console to this package and this signing certificate, which is
 * what makes it safe to compile into a public APK. Google's own SDK proves both automatically, so
 * the vector map drew at once — and every plain web call the app makes (tiles, routes, places,
 * elevation) was refused the moment the restriction was saved:
 *
 *     "Requests from this Android client application <empty> are blocked."
 *
 * <empty> is the app failing to say who it is. A web-service call carries no package name unless
 * it is written into the request, so Google sees an Android-restricted key arriving from nobody.
 * Two headers fix it, and they are the documented way: the package name, and the SHA-1 of the
 * certificate that signed the running app.
 *
 * READ FROM THE INSTALLED APP, NOT WRITTEN DOWN. The fingerprint is computed from whatever
 * certificate actually signed this build, so a debug build and a release build each send their own
 * and neither has to be remembered.
