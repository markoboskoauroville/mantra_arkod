/**
 * THE SETTINGS, WRITTEN AGAIN FROM NOTHING (17.9.2026).
 *
 * Baba: *"When I click on Google View, the checkbox, it doesn't appear. I need to click multiple
 * times and then it's laggy."* He was right, and the cause was structural rather than a slip.
 *
 * The old face read the store DURING COMPOSITION — store.familyInToggle(...) inside the row that
 * drew the tick. A tap wrote to the preferences and nothing told Compose anything had changed, so
 * the tick did not move until some other thing happened to redraw the screen. Every read was also
 * a preferences read, dozens of them per frame, which is the lag.
 *
 * So this face reads the store ONCE, when it opens, into a holder that Compose watches. A tap
 * changes the holder — the screen redraws immediately, because that is what the holder is for —
 * and writes through to the store behind it. Nothing is read from disk while a frame is drawn.
