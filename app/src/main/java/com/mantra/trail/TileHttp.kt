/**
 * FETCHING A TILE WITH THE STACK THAT IS KNOWN TO WORK (17.9.2026).
 *
 * The URL this app builds for Google is right — proved on a desk, byte for byte, returning a
 * 256-pixel PNG — and still nothing drew. VTM's own client cannot do https; its OkHttp engine
 * should, and did not either. Rather than guess a third time at somebody else's networking, the
 * tiles now go through java.net.HttpURLConnection: the same thing that fetches the session, the
 * routes, the elevations and the map downloads, every one of which has worked all week.
 *
 * It also REPORTS. What came back for the last tile — the status, the size, the reason — is kept
 * where the settings can show it, because "the map is white" is not something anybody can debug
 * and "403 on tile 16/35762/23697" is.
