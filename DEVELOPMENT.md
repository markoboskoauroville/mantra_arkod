# Development

Past tense. Every decision and the reason it was made, appended, never rewritten.

## 14.9.2026 — v1, the first build

**The name.** Baba asked for a clone of Outdooractive and first called the app that. Outdooractive
is a live product from a German company and the repository is public, so the app was named Mantra
Trail instead.

**Google cannot be cached, and that decided the shape of the app.** The first sketch had Google as
the main map with a cache behind it. Google's Map Tiles API policies forbid pre-fetching, indexing,
storing or caching content and name offline use as a prohibited case; the Maps SDK for Android
carries the same restriction with place IDs as the only exemption. So Google became one layer of
four, online only, labelled as such — and the offline work went to maps whose licences allow it.

**TK25 was proved before it was designed around.** The state survey's WMS was asked for a single
256 px tile in EPSG:3857 over Velebit: HTTP 200, `image/png`, 65,487 bytes, 33,562 opaque pixels
and 1,933 distinct colours. A 200 with a blank tile would have looked identical from the status
code alone, which is why the colours were counted (`silent-failure.md`: check the outcome, not the
operation).

**GPX 1.1 over FIT, TCX and KML**, because everything reads it and the schema is published. It is
written point by point rather than assembled at the end: a file assembled at the end does not exist
when the battery dies on the ridge.

**Accuracy is the state, so it carries the colour.** Sand under 10 m, amber to 50 m, red past it,
dim when the phone will not say. The ring on the map is drawn to scale in metres, because a number
in a corner is read as a score and a circle is read as the ground the fix cannot tell apart.

**The ascent threshold is 3 m.** Without it a phone lying still on a table records a climb, because
its altitude wanders by several metres a minute. Test 1 asserts exactly that case.

**Pitch and roll use atan2 against the other two axes, not asin.** The asin version is correct up
to 45 degrees and wrong past it, which is the worst way to be wrong: it looks right in every casual
check. Tilt composes the two exactly, so 3 degrees one way and 4 the other is 5 off level, not 7.

**The compass filter wraps.** Averaging 359 and 1 the ordinary way gives 180 and points the needle
exactly backwards, at the moment somebody is watching it. `Level.smoothAngle` goes the short way
round and Test 1 closes it.

**Five expectations in Test 1 were wrong before any code was.** A tile number, an epoch in
milliseconds and a tag count where `<trk` was also matching `trkseg` and `trkpt`. All five were
invented rather than measured; all five were measured and corrected. The harness has been seen to
fail, so it is not a rumour.

**mapsforge's API was read from its own sources rather than guessed**, and `MapCanvas.kt` was
typechecked against the real jars and `android.jar` with kotlinc before anything was pushed. That
is not a local build — it produces no artefact — and it removed several CI rounds.

**A local Gradle build was attempted and abandoned.** The sandbox had a JRE and no compiler, and
the attempt was the wrong instinct: Baba's answer was to write the rule into the manifest instead.
`android-app.md` §1a now says the APK is built by GitHub Actions and never on a desk, with the
three reasons — provenance, a reproducible environment, and the one signing key.

## 14.9.2026 — v1 build 1 was red, and the check that should have caught it was mine

`InternalRenderTheme` does not exist in mapsforge 0.25.0; the themes are
`org.mapsforge.map.rendertheme.internal.MapsforgeThemes`. Two lines, and CI found them in six
minutes.

**It should not have reached CI.** The file had been typechecked locally against the real jars and
reported clean — because the filter was `grep -E "^(error|warning)"` and this kotlinc writes
`Broken.kt:1:10: error: unresolved reference`, with the word in the middle of the line and not at
the start of it. **A check that cannot fail looks exactly like a check that passes**
(`checking-the-checks.md`). The filter was replaced with the compiler's own exit status, and then
proved by breaking `Geo.normaliseDeg` on purpose: exit 1 with 51 errors broken, exit 0 restored.

The restore is worth its own line. The first attempt to put the deliberately broken file back ran
after a `return` in a shell function and never executed, so the next run reported 51 errors that
were all my own sabotage. **When you sabotage something on purpose, confirm the repair before
reading the next result** (four-tests.md Test 3: exclude the error you caused yourself).

## 14.9.2026 — v2 was red on a dependency declared twice

`mapsforge-map-android` already depends on `com.caverock:androidsvg` as a plain jar. Declaring
`androidsvg-aar` alongside it put both on the path, and `checkReleaseDuplicateClasses` counted
every class in the library twice. The line came out: the library is still there, brought by the
module that needs it, which is also the module that will keep choosing the right version.

## 14.9.2026 — v3 was red on a lint check that was right

`play-services-maps` brings a fragment library old enough that `registerForActivityResult` is
unsafe against it, and lint said so three times. The temptation was to disable the check; what it
was reporting is real, and the file pickers and the permission request all go through exactly that
call. A modern `androidx.fragment` was named as a dependency so resolution raises the version.
**A blocking lint is narrowed in the session it cries wolf, never carried, and never silenced when
it is telling the truth.**

## 27.9.2026 — v82, the cadastre from the portal, with the owners

Marko asked for the parcel layer of the portal's *Your position* page (he called it "ARKOD"; the
page draws the state cadastre, `cp:CP.CadastralParcel` from api.uredjenazemlja.hr), with a tap that
shows the owners and a way to type or pick parcels and highlight them, in the trail colours.

**Three services, all public, all measured before a line was written.** The WMS draws; its
GetFeatureInfo refuses JSON, so a tap asks the **WFS** for the parcels in a box twenty metres across
and picks the one whose polygon holds the point (ray casting, in `Parcels.kt`, tested). The record
with the possessors comes from **OSS** by parcel id; OSS answers an app and refuses a browser (403
when an Origin header is present), which is why the phone can do this and the portal page cannot
without a relay on the machine. Search is one WFS request with `nationalCadastralReference IN
(...)`, the municipality taken from `cp:CadastralZoning` under the middle of the map.

**VTM asks tiles as base/z/x/y and a WMS wants a box**, so the cadastre's tiles are asked at
`WMS/z/x/y` and `Parcels.resolve` turns them into the real GetMap on the way out of `TileHttp`.
512 px at 180 dpi, so the numbers are the size the portal shows them on a phone's density.

**The state's lines are black**, invisible on a photograph or the night theme. Every tile is
recoloured on the phone into dark or sand ink at 62 %, chosen by the map underneath; the Google
engine uses the same function through a `TileProvider`.

**A highlight keeps the shape**, not only the number, so his land is drawn on a hillside with no
signal. Names in the tests are invented; no real person's record is in this repository.

## 27.9.2026 — v83, the tap reaches the cadastre

On the Pixel 7 emulator v82 drew the cadastre over Kukljica exactly as the portal does, and a tap
on parcel 2451 did nothing: a VTM layer listening for its TAP gesture was never called. The tap is
now caught by Android's own GestureDetector on the map view, which passes every touch on to the
map, and "single tap confirmed" keeps the double tap for zooming.
